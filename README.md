### About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hritvik, a passionate and driven developer currently working as a Technical Program Associate at Newton School. With almost ~2 years of experience in Full Stack Development, I specialize in building innovative and scalable web applications. I have a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development, and I love learning and growing through hands-on projects.

I'm actively building exciting apps and exploring new technologies, including Kotlin and Android development. Currently, I'm working on several personal projects, such as:

- **Launchpad**: A platform helping users find government schemes, job opportunities, and scholarships.
- **Tool Base**: A collection of handy tools for tasks like file conversions and video downloads.
- **Better Anki**: Enhancing the Anki app experience for learners.

I also love contributing to open-source projects and am always looking for new challenges that push my skills further.

Outside of coding, I enjoy solving complex problems and building things that make a difference. Feel free to check out my repositories and let's connect!
