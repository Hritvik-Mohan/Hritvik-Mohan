### About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm Hritvik, a passionate and driven developer 💻 currently working as a Technical Program Associate at Newton School. With almost 2 years of experience in Full Stack Development, I specialize in building innovative and scalable web applications. I have a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development, and I love learning and growing through hands-on projects 🚀.

I'm actively building exciting apps and exploring new technologies, including Kotlin and Android development 📱. Currently, I'm working on several personal projects, such as:

- **Launchpad**: A platform helping users find government schemes, job opportunities, and scholarships 🎓💼.
- **Better Anki**: Enhancing the Anki app experience for learners 📚.

I also love contributing to open-source projects and am always looking for new challenges that push my skills further 🔥.

Outside of coding, I enjoy solving complex problems and building things that make a difference 🌱. Feel free to check out my repositories and let's connect! 🤝
