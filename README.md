### About Me

Hi there! I'm Hritvik, a Software Development Engineer at **Newton School**, Bengaluru. I work across the full stack - building mobile apps, desktop applications, APIs, and backend systems.

Some of the things I work on:

- **Mobile Applications** — Cross-platform apps using React Native
- **Desktop Applications** — Electron-based tools featuring discrete event simulation for distributed systems
- **Detection Systems** — Intelligent content analysis and plagiarism detection pipelines
- **API Platforms** — Backend services powering products at scale

I enjoy working at the intersection of **system design**, **simulation theory**, and **practical engineering** — turning concepts like queueing theory and network models into real, usable tools.

**Tech I work with:** React, React Native, Electron, Node.js, and more across the JS/TS ecosystem.

Outside of code, I'm a cinema enthusiast with a deep love for directors like Fincher, Nolan, Villeneuve, and Tarkovsky. Always happy to talk films, system design, or interesting problems.

Let's connect!
